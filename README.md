# My solutions to Advent of Code 2023
Hi there, I am Chechu and this repository contains my 
solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/), 
provided with the examples generated for me.

I'm using C++, trying to implement all methods myself 
rather than relying on pre-made methods and solutions
as much as I can in order to learn C++ and put my skills
on test.

## Progress
Day 1 - 06/12/2023
Day 2 - 07/12/2023

## Getting started
If you're willing to do the advent of code 
yourself, do not look at my code, it's funnier 
that way.

### Prerequisite
You'll need a C++ compiler and to modify the Makefile 
according to your system requirements (or compile manually).

Note that each .cpp file has its own `int main() {}` 
entry point, so they are individual one from each 
other, even duplicate methods.

## Usage
You can use `make all` to build each and every day 
and part at once and then run them individually 
with a simple `./day01/build/part1` (change day01 
and part1)

### Cleaning build artifacts
To clean up compiled binaries, you can use
`make clean`.
